           <u>Analog In, Digital Out: Brendan Dawes on Interaction Design,</u> 
            shows how he changes his ways of thinking about products and interfaces and how he applies 
            creativity and uniqueness to interaction design. He took interaction design and explained his 
            thought process on his creations in a fun and enjoyable way because interaction design is fun 
            and enjoyable. I found this book extremely interesting for that reason, there was so much 
            excitement with every project explained in the book, giving me excitement about reading it. 
            Brendan Dawes made every section interesting, one that really resonated with me was section 3. 
            Brown Paper and String Moments. This section was talking about our crave as humans for 
            experiences as Dawes says, “The experience of an object, the little special details, 
            which makes us want to interact with it in some way, physically or emotionally.” 
            He then goes on to give an example where he compares the experience he had with an expensive, 
            nicely packaged cheese to one he would have with a generic, low effort appearance cheese. 
            Even though the cheeses tasted nearly the same, the more admirable cheese will win because 
            you're paying for the experience. We constantly pay for experiences because once again 
            Dawes says, “We're humans, full of flaws, we're not machines that make decisions based 
            simply on efficiency.” The way Dawes shows his thoughts in his reading makes it extremely 
            enjoyable to read, all the explanations are laid out making his writing very clear. 
            I thought the way the watch, cheese, and bag were all completely different examples but 
            connected perfectly and made sense.

            This book connects to my degree, UX/ID or, User Experience and Interaction Design. 
            Brendan Dawes dives into everything related to interaction design, different ways to think about design, 
            different interface options, how to get creative about your design, and so many more. 
            My degree will teach me how to create interaction design while applying user experience knowledge, 
            this book perfectly covers those topics. Using the psychology of humans to better understand 
            the user experience, Dawes then takes that and applies it when creating a new product or design 
            relating to interaction design.

            The findings and notes taken on this book will be a great help for the rest of my career at Drexel University. 
            With multiple insights to be taken away with every section of reading, I plan on taking those 
            insights and lessons and applying them to my studies. The very first lesson learned was to look up, 
            don't get distracted trying to get from point A to B as fast as possible, if you do this the world 
            will become invisible as you miss what's going on around you. I plan on doing this every day, 
            I want to walk around and look up and around to “open my mind to the world of input that constantly surrounds us.” 
            New things are always ready to be found; you just have to look for them. This book taught me: that I can break down 
            big problems to make them simpler, not to wonder if my idea is even possible and instead just start working at it, 
            to think outside the box, and lots more that I plan to use going forward.

            <u>Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability</u> highlights everything a 
            designer needs to know in order to build great and usable websites. The mission of this book is to give such 
            good insights that if you read it, you won't need to hire someone like Steve Krug because you can do it yourself. 
            Specifically, Krug wrote the book for people who can't afford to hire someone like him. The overall goal is to make 
            the objectives and goals of user experience easy to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the book, Steve Krug goes over four main topics crucial to the understanding of good design for 
            Usability on the web. The first, guiding principles of web design. Don't make me think! The most important usability law, 
            creating something obvious and self explanatory to the point where the user doesn't need to think about the design. 
            When you accomplish this, you've created a good design. “The point is that every question mark adds to our cognitive workload, 
            distracting our attention from the task at hand. The distractions may be slight but they add up, especially if it's 
            something we do all the time like deciding what to click on.” (Krug 24) This quote highlights how users question their 
            moves on websites due to a poor design that forces the user to think and question what certain features on a website do. 
            Before teaching how to build a good design, Krug goes over how users read websites. It's important to understand what the 
            user is looking at on a website, and what they're paying attention to. This way, the designer can ensure what they want to 
            be seen, will be seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second main topic focused on designing navigation. Users need their eyes to be directed through the web with clear 
            pathways to take them where they want to go. Without a sense of direction or location the user will feel lost in the website. 
            Krug thoroughly explains how you can achieve good navigation design. Navigation reveals the important content within the website, 
            good navigation will lead the user right to what they want. Having a well designed homepage is critical, it not only starts the 
            user on a good note, but it also adds to good navigation for the rest of the site. A good homepage has many needs to meet 
            such as: advertising deals, shortcuts, and registration. Homepages also need to be able to show the user what they're looking 
            for and not looking for, show them where to start, and establish trust with the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to ensure a design will work as intended, usability tests are performed. T
            he third main topic narrows down on making sure the reader understands the previous two sections. 
            Krug explains how usability testing establishes how successful the initial design is. By testing, you gain the 
            insights of your target audience which clears any debates or worries about the website. Testing will highlight the flaws 
            as well as show what works.
            </p>
        <p>
            Finally, Krug finishes off by connecting all of the information and explaining how it applies when it is finished and in the real world. 
            Krug explains how a website will never be perfect. As things change, we need to adapt to those changes. This section showed how the 
            outside world affects website structure and design.
        <p>
            Steve Krug's, Don't Make Me Think: Revisited, was written in a way where any person could pick up this book and understand 
            what is being talked about. Every sentence where I had a question, it was answered in the next. Krug presents the perfect 
            amount of information, I never felt overwhelmed reading, as well as I was never bored. The information was relevant and felt 
            useful. With every point Krug made, he verified it with picture proof. Inserted throughout the entire book are pictures and 
            captions and arrows thoroughly explaining what I was supposed to be learning.
